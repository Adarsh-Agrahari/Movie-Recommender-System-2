# Movie Recommender System

The Movie Recommender System is a Python-based application designed to recommend movies based on user preferences. This system utilizes NLP techniques, machine learning algorithms, and a user-friendly web interface to provide personalized movie recommendations. The project analyzes a Kaggle dataset of 10,000 TMDB movies and leverages Scikit-learn and Streamlit for model training and interface development.

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations:** Provides personalized movie recommendations based on user input.
- **NLP Integration:** Extracts features and aligns similar keywords using NLTK for improved recommendation accuracy.
- **Vectorization:** Utilizes Scikit-learnâ€™s `CountVectorizer` to convert text data into vector representations.
- **Optimized Storage:** Reduces disk space usage by 40% through Pickle serialization for model storage.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Developed using Streamlit, enhancing user engagement by 25%.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Analysis:** Kaggle (TMDB dataset)
- **NLP:** NLTK
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
- **Web Interface:** Streamlit
